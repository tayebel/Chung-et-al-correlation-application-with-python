# Chung_et_al_correlation

The purpose of this program is to apply the correlation of Chung et al to calculate the solubility of CO2 in oil (dead oil) (  of several Laboratory experiments by uploading Excel data) as a function of three input variables, namely pressure (Ps, psia), temperature (T, °C) and oil density.

chung et al correlation:

Rs = 1/ [ 0.02770441γ^4.0928  (1.8 T+32)^0.2499+ 3.20617×10^(-6)×(1.8 T+32)^0.2499× exp( - 0.098057Ps     -5.3889/Ps) ]
