# Chung_et_al_correlation
Chung et al established a relationship between the solubility of CO2 in oil (dead  oil) and three input variables, namely pressure (Ps, psia), temperature (T, °C) and density  of the oil:
Rs = 1/ [ 0.02770441γ^4.0928  (1.8 T+32)^0.2499+ 3.20617×10^(-6)×(1.8 T+32)^0.2499× exp( - 0.098057Ps     -5.3889/Ps) ]
